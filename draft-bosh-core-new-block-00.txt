                      draft-bosh-core-new-block-00

Abstract

   This document specifies new Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)
   Block-Wiset transfer options that are meant to accommodate scenarios
   not initially covered by RFC 7959.

1.  Introduction

   Only the deviation from Block1 and Block2 options will be specified.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119][RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Readers should be familiar with the terms and concepts defined in
   [RFC7252].

3.  The Block3 and Block4 Options

   The properties of Block3 ad Block4 options are shown in Table 1.  The
   formatting of this table follows the one used in Table 4 of [RFC7252]
   (Section 5.10).  The C, U, N, and R columns indicate the properties
   Critical, Unsafe, NoCacheKey, and Repeatable defined in Section 5.4
   of [RFC7252].  Since NoCacheKey only has a meaning for options that
   are Safe-to-Forward, the N column is filled with a dash for Block3 ad
   Block4 options.

Internet-Draft       New Block-Wise Transfer Options          April 2020


    +--------+---+---+---+---+-----------+--------+--------+---------+
    | Number | C | U | N | R | Name      | Format | Length | Default |
    +--------+---+---+---+---+-----------+--------+--------+---------+
    |  TBA1  | x | x | - |   | Block3    | uint   |  0-3   |   None  |
    |  TBA2  | x | x | - |   | Block4    | uint   |  0-3   |   None  |
    +--------+---+---+---+---+-----------+--------+--------+---------+

               Table 1: CoAP Block3 ad Block4 Option Properties

   The Block3 Option pertains to the request payload, and the Block4
   Option pertains to the response payload.

   Both Block3 and Block4 options are not repeatable.  Therefore, any
   request carrying multiple Block3 (or Block4) options MUST be handled
   following the procedure specified in Section 5.4.5 of [RFC7252].

   The structure of Block3 ad Block4 options MUST follow the structure
   defined in Secion 2.2 of [RFC7959].

   The Block3 ad Block4 options are not safe to forward.

5.  Caching Considerations

6.  HTTP-Mapping Considerations

   This section focuses on the HTTP mappings specific to the CoAP
   extension specified in this document.  As a reminder, the basic
   normative requirements on HTTP/CoAP mappings are defined in
   Section 10 of [RFC7252].  The implementation guidelines for HTTP/CoAP
   mappings are elaborated in [RFC8075].

   The rules defined in Section 5 of [RFC7959] are to be followed.

7.  IANA Considerations

      Editorial Note: Please update TBA1/TBA2 statements within the
      document with the assigned codes.

7.1.  CoAP Option Numbers

   IANA is requested to add the following entry to the "CoAP Option
   Numbers" sub-registry available at https://www.iana.org/assignments/
   core-parameters/core-parameters.xhtml#option-numbers:

               +--------+------------------+-----------+
               | Number | Name             | Reference |
               +--------+------------------+-----------+
               |  TBA1  | Block3           | [RFCXXXX] |
               |  TBA2  | Block4           | [RFCXXXX] |
               +--------+------------------+-----------+

               Table 3: CoAP Block3 ad Block4 Option Numbers

   This document suggests XX and XX as a values to be assigned for the
   new option numbers.

8.  Security Considerations

   Security considerations discussed in Section 9 of [RFC7959] should be
   taken into account.
